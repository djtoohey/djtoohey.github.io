                <p> Born in Hobart Tasmania, Australia, in the Year 2000 and raised in South East Asia, two years in
                    Brunei and eight in Singapore, moved to Adelaide in 2015. Declan has had an interest in Computer
                    Science/Information Technology since Year 1. This developed through playing games such as Minecraft,
                    Team Fortress 2, Terraria,Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Defence of the Ancients 2 (DOTA2) and
                    many others.
                    <br><br>
                    This lead to doing some sort of IT throughout schooling, although was a complusary subject from
                    Years 1 to 5, yet decided to stick with it as he found it enjoyable and interesting. After moving
                    to Adelaide, he focused more on his IT, taking full elective subjects for computer sciene right
                    through highschool. Also taking a course outside of regular school hours to obtain a Certificate III
                    in Information, Digital Media and Technology. This all paid off as in 2018, in his final year of
                    schooling, was able to aquire a merit A+ for IT, only one of two for the cohort.
                    <br><br>
                    After completing highschool, he went straight into University study. However, 1 semester into the
                    course he found it to be bland and rehashing everything that was taught in highschool and what he
                    thought should have been assumed knowledge. In so, just as he turned 19 he decided that University
                    was not the right path for him, well for the moment. He focused on working at KFC and a few other
                    organisations for financial gain and experience in other fields besides IT.
                    <br><br>
                    Nine months later, while scrolling through the internet, Declan came across an advertisement for a
                    University of Adelaide course offering a 24 week intensive course on Fullstack Development. He is
                    currently attending these courses at night and on weekends while still being able to work during
                    weekdays.
